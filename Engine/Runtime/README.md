# V1-M4 through V1-M12 runtime contracts

`NexoraRuntime` is the dependency-ordered, platform-neutral baseline for the remaining V1
milestones. It deliberately contains no SDK-specific physics, media, mobile, or editor backend.
Instead, it makes the ownership and safety boundaries executable before those integrations land.

| Milestone | Executable baseline |
| --- | --- |
| M4 | Additive scene lifecycle, stable entity IDs, deferred safe unload, double-precision transforms |
| M5 | Hash-validated asset generations, dependency-cycle rejection, pinning and rollback |
| M6 | Plugin ABI validation, service discovery and undo transactions |
| M7 | Device-neutral input routing, stable touch IDs, virtual-list materialization and locale fallback |
| M8 | Separate character intent and resolved motion; query-only navigation paths do not write transforms |
| M9 | Animation playback, bounded audio voices, reference-counted residency and a timestamped media queue |
| M10 | Separate cell/bundle identity, observable RAM/VRAM use, HLOD state and occupied-cell pins |
| M11 | App lifecycle, pressure policy and native WebView pointer ownership |
| M12 | Profile-driven plugin, shader, optional-asset and headless presentation stripping |

The contract test `runtime.v1_m4_m12_contracts` exercises every row, including localization
fallback, unreachable navigation, animation looping, audio voice limits, media back-pressure and
seek invalidation. Platform SDK adapters and production authoring tools remain future work and
must preserve these interfaces rather than bypassing their lifecycle checks.
