# Nexora Graphical Editor Roadmap

> Version: v1.1 | Status: planning baseline | Updated: 2026-09-23

> **Progress: 0%** (none of ED-M0 through ED-M7 has passed graphical Editor acceptance;
> completed Runtime/Editor SDK prerequisites are not rounded up into an Editor milestone.)

**Completed prerequisites:** ✅ reflection metadata; ✅ command/undo data model;
✅ prefab override/rebase; ✅ isolated PIE session; ✅ dynamic plugin ABI gate; ✅ standalone
process and portable workspace/document core. **Open:** window/docking/UI shell,
graphical views, authoring workflows, and production hardening.

## 1. Product vision

Build a standalone `NexoraEditor` with a Unity/Unreal-like workflow—not a claim of feature parity. Its first production path covers Project Browser, Hierarchy, Scene View, Game View, Inspector, Content Browser, Console, Profiler, gizmos, undo/redo, Play-in-Editor (PIE), and import/cook/build. The Editor consumes Runtime APIs and is never required by a shipped game.

## 2. Architecture boundaries

```text
NexoraEditor (tool process)
  UI shell/docking/commands/workspace persistence
  editor documents, selection, and transactions
  Scene/Game surfaces and gizmos
  asset and build/cook/package frontends
          |
          v public Runtime/Renderer/Asset/Editor SDK APIs
  Editor World -- snapshot/clone --> Play World
```

Editor metadata stays out of Shipping components. Selection stores stable IDs, not relocatable pointers. Every mutation is a transaction, including property edits, gizmo drags, reparenting, and multi-edit. PIE clones an isolated Play World and discards changes unless explicitly applied. Engine Core cannot depend on the UI framework; [ADR-0001](ADR-0001-Editor-UI-Framework.md) records that evaluation (docking, IME, accessibility, multi-viewport support, and maintenance) and its outcome. Extensions register panels, commands, importers, and inspectors through the versioned Editor SDK only.

## 3. Milestones

Milestones are delivered in strict order: **ED-M0 → ED-M1 → ED-M2**. The Editor must not begin
production widget implementation before ED-M0 settles its product and UX contracts. In particular,
the shell depends on the public window/swapchain path and must not invent a temporary private
presentation path merely to display UI.

### ED-M0 — Product shell and UX contract

Define supported operating systems, project/workspace formats, stable panel IDs, command and
shortcut routing, docking, theme, DPI, IME, accessibility, and crash recovery. Select the UI
framework through an ADR and focused prototypes; wireframes or an isolated widget demo do not
satisfy this milestone.

- ✅ The standalone `NexoraEditor` process, versioned project/workspace format, stable panel IDs,
  command namespace, atomic workspace replacement, and recovery journal are implemented.
- ✅ UI-framework ADR: [ADR-0001](ADR-0001-Editor-UI-Framework.md) selects Dear ImGui
  (docking/multi-viewport), rendered through `Nexora::RHI` rather than a competing windowing
  stack, and names the accessibility gap ED-M7 still has to scope. The ADR settles the framework
  choice only -- it is not itself graphical docking, theme, DPI, IME, accessibility, or crash UX.
- Open: graphical docking, theme, DPI, IME wiring, the accessibility direction ADR-0001 names, and
  crash UX. [Editor_ImGui_Integration_Plan.md](Editor_ImGui_Integration_Plan.md) plans this
  remaining scope in phases; it is a proposed plan, not yet started.

### ED-M1 — Project and asset workspace

Create, open, and upgrade projects. Deliver a Content Browser with search/filter, folder/UUID,
drag/drop, import status, dependency inspection, and reimport. Background import must expose
cancellation, progress, and actionable errors, and must produce deterministic artifacts.

- ✅ Project create/open, deterministic content-tree indexing, UUID/path search and filtering,
  cancellation, progress, inspectable errors, and deterministic artifact hashes are implemented.
- Open: graphical Content Browser, drag/drop, dependency inspection, and reimport UX.

### ED-M2 — Scene authoring core

Deliver Hierarchy, Scene View, Inspector, camera controls, selection/picking, translate/rotate/scale
gizmos, parenting/reordering, multi-selection, clipboard, undo/redo, and save/reload. Reflection
creates property widgets; unknown components retain raw data instead of being silently discarded.

- ✅ Stable-ID hierarchy/selection, cycle-safe reparenting, multi-selection, clipboard duplication,
  transform transactions, undo, and atomic scene save/reload are implemented in Editor Core.
- Open: graphical Hierarchy/Scene/Inspector, picking, camera controls, gizmos, reflected widgets,
  and unknown-component visual workflows.

- **ED-M3 — PIE/debugging:** Game View, play/pause/step, fixed ticks, input focus, isolated worlds, apply policy, Console, runtime inspection, debugger boundary. The engine loads Zig gameplay; the Editor is not Zig `main`.
  - ✅ Portable `PlaySession` prerequisite covers isolated Play World ownership, fixed tick,
    play/pause/step, input-focus policy, discard-by-default, and explicit transform apply-back.
  - Open: graphical Game View, Console/runtime inspection, and debugger integration.
- **ED-M4 — Prefabs/scenes/collaboration safety:** variants, override diff/revert/apply, nested rebase, additive scenes, migrations, autosave/recovery, external-change detection, and readable diff/merge. Safe source control precedes live collaboration.
  - ✅ Portable prefab prerequisite covers inspectable override diffs, targeted/full revert,
    immutable apply, variants, and nested-path rebase.
  - Open: graphical workflows, additive scene tooling, migrations, recovery, and source-control diff/merge.
- **ED-M5 — Specialized tools:** material/shader graph, animation, particles/VFX, audio, navigation/physics debug, terrain/vegetation, localization. Each is a capability plugin with honest read-only/unavailable states.
  - ✅ Portable capability registry enforces stable tool IDs and honest implemented/read-only/
    unavailable states with fallback reasons.
  - Open: graphical specialized tools and capability plugins backed by each production subsystem.
- **ED-M6 — Build/profile/extensibility:** profiles, cook/package, target/device matrix, remote logs, CPU/GPU/memory/frame tools, plugin manager, and API docs. Build success includes a target manifest and reproducible command.
  - ✅ Portable build frontend validates and atomically writes target/configuration/command and
    checksummed artifact manifests; monotonic CPU/GPU/memory frame capture is implemented.
  - Open: graphical frontend, remote deployment/logs, live profiler integration, and plugin manager.
- **ED-M7 — Production hardening:** incremental indexing, virtualized UI, 100k-entity hierarchy, soak, workspace migration, corrupt recovery, signed-extension policy, opt-in telemetry/privacy, keyboard and screen-reader audit.
  - ✅ 100k-item virtual hierarchy ranges, trusted-publisher/signature policy, and telemetry that
    drops events until explicit opt-in are covered by portable tests.
  - Open: graphical performance/soak acceptance, workspace migrations, corrupt-document recovery,
    and keyboard/screen-reader audits.

## 4. Persistence and transaction contract

Scene, Prefab, and Project formats are versioned, deterministic, and atomically written. Commands contain stable targets, reversible before/after state, merge keys, and authoring timestamps that do not affect simulation. Long operations stage then commit; recovery journals preserve the last good file. Schema migrations support dry runs, backups, and reports; major versions never silently downgrade.

## 5. Acceptance matrix

| Area | Automated gate | Human/visual gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Documents | golden round trip, migration, corruption/fuzz | recovery workflow |
| Transactions | property tests and 1,000-step replay | gizmo and multi-edit behavior |
| Scene View | picking/gizmo math and render contracts | DPI, viewport, resize |
| PIE | isolation, start/stop stress, state diff | focus and pause/step workflow |
| Assets | deterministic import, cancellation/rollback, cycles | browser/status usability |
| Extensions | ABI/version/capability rejection | install/disable/recovery |
| Performance | startup/index/frame/interaction baselines | representative large project |

## 6. Release slices, dependencies, and non-goals

**Editor Preview** requires all of ED-M0, ED-M1, and ED-M2; none of those milestones alone qualifies.
**Creator Alpha** adds M3/M4, and **Production Beta** adds selected specialized tools, build/profile,
and hardening. Labels follow acceptance evidence, not panel existence or prerequisite groundwork.
Dependencies include Engine API M1–M5, window/swapchain, reflection, the asset pipeline, scene
snapshots, and the Editor SDK. Completed reflection, undo-model, or prefab foundations therefore do
not make the graphical Editor complete. Full visual scripting, a marketplace, cloud collaboration,
cinematic tooling, and every remote platform are separate future roadmaps.
