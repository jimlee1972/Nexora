# Nexora Graphical Editor Roadmap

> Version: v1.1 | Status: planning baseline | Updated: 2026-09-23

> **Progress: 0%** (none of ED-M0 through ED-M7 has passed graphical Editor acceptance;
> completed Runtime/Editor SDK prerequisites are not rounded up into an Editor milestone.)

**Completed prerequisites:** ✅ reflection metadata; ✅ command/undo data model;
✅ prefab override/rebase; ✅ dynamic plugin ABI gate. **Open:** window/docking/UI shell,
graphical views, authoring workflows, and production hardening.

## 1. Product vision

Build a standalone `NexoraEditor` with a Unity/Unreal-like workflow—not a claim of feature parity. Its first production path covers Project Browser, Hierarchy, Scene View, Game View, Inspector, Content Browser, Console, Profiler, gizmos, undo/redo, Play-in-Editor (PIE), and import/cook/build. The Editor consumes Runtime APIs and is never required by a shipped game.

## 2. Architecture boundaries

```text
NexoraEditor (tool process)
  UI shell/docking/commands/workspace persistence
  editor documents, selection, and transactions
  Scene/Game surfaces and gizmos
  asset and build/cook/package frontends
          |
          v public Runtime/Renderer/Asset/Editor SDK APIs
  Editor World -- snapshot/clone --> Play World
```

Editor metadata stays out of Shipping components. Selection stores stable IDs, not relocatable pointers. Every mutation is a transaction, including property edits, gizmo drags, reparenting, and multi-edit. PIE clones an isolated Play World and discards changes unless explicitly applied. Engine Core cannot depend on the UI framework; an ADR evaluates docking, IME, accessibility, multi-viewport support, and maintenance. Extensions register panels, commands, importers, and inspectors through the versioned Editor SDK only.

## 3. Milestones

Milestones are delivered in strict order: **ED-M0 → ED-M1 → ED-M2**. The Editor must not begin
production widget implementation before ED-M0 settles its product and UX contracts. In particular,
the shell depends on the public window/swapchain path and must not invent a temporary private
presentation path merely to display UI.

### ED-M0 — Product shell and UX contract

Define supported operating systems, project/workspace formats, stable panel IDs, command and
shortcut routing, docking, theme, DPI, IME, accessibility, and crash recovery. Select the UI
framework through an ADR and focused prototypes; wireframes or an isolated widget demo do not
satisfy this milestone.

### ED-M1 — Project and asset workspace

Create, open, and upgrade projects. Deliver a Content Browser with search/filter, folder/UUID,
drag/drop, import status, dependency inspection, and reimport. Background import must expose
cancellation, progress, and actionable errors, and must produce deterministic artifacts.

### ED-M2 — Scene authoring core

Deliver Hierarchy, Scene View, Inspector, camera controls, selection/picking, translate/rotate/scale
gizmos, parenting/reordering, multi-selection, clipboard, undo/redo, and save/reload. Reflection
creates property widgets; unknown components retain raw data instead of being silently discarded.

- **ED-M3 — PIE/debugging:** Game View, play/pause/step, fixed ticks, input focus, isolated worlds, apply policy, Console, runtime inspection, debugger boundary. The engine loads Zig gameplay; the Editor is not Zig `main`.
- **ED-M4 — Prefabs/scenes/collaboration safety:** variants, override diff/revert/apply, nested rebase, additive scenes, migrations, autosave/recovery, external-change detection, and readable diff/merge. Safe source control precedes live collaboration.
- **ED-M5 — Specialized tools:** material/shader graph, animation, particles/VFX, audio, navigation/physics debug, terrain/vegetation, localization. Each is a capability plugin with honest read-only/unavailable states.
- **ED-M6 — Build/profile/extensibility:** profiles, cook/package, target/device matrix, remote logs, CPU/GPU/memory/frame tools, plugin manager, and API docs. Build success includes a target manifest and reproducible command.
- **ED-M7 — Production hardening:** incremental indexing, virtualized UI, 100k-entity hierarchy, soak, workspace migration, corrupt recovery, signed-extension policy, opt-in telemetry/privacy, keyboard and screen-reader audit.

## 4. Persistence and transaction contract

Scene, Prefab, and Project formats are versioned, deterministic, and atomically written. Commands contain stable targets, reversible before/after state, merge keys, and authoring timestamps that do not affect simulation. Long operations stage then commit; recovery journals preserve the last good file. Schema migrations support dry runs, backups, and reports; major versions never silently downgrade.

## 5. Acceptance matrix

| Area | Automated gate | Human/visual gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Documents | golden round trip, migration, corruption/fuzz | recovery workflow |
| Transactions | property tests and 1,000-step replay | gizmo and multi-edit behavior |
| Scene View | picking/gizmo math and render contracts | DPI, viewport, resize |
| PIE | isolation, start/stop stress, state diff | focus and pause/step workflow |
| Assets | deterministic import, cancellation/rollback, cycles | browser/status usability |
| Extensions | ABI/version/capability rejection | install/disable/recovery |
| Performance | startup/index/frame/interaction baselines | representative large project |

## 6. Release slices, dependencies, and non-goals

**Editor Preview** requires all of ED-M0, ED-M1, and ED-M2; none of those milestones alone qualifies.
**Creator Alpha** adds M3/M4, and **Production Beta** adds selected specialized tools, build/profile,
and hardening. Labels follow acceptance evidence, not panel existence or prerequisite groundwork.
Dependencies include Engine API M1–M5, window/swapchain, reflection, the asset pipeline, scene
snapshots, and the Editor SDK. Completed reflection, undo-model, or prefab foundations therefore do
not make the graphical Editor complete. Full visual scripting, a marketplace, cloud collaboration,
cinematic tooling, and every remote platform are separate future roadmaps.
